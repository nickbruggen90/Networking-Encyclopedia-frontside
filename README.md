# ðŸ“šEncyclopedia: Vol. 802.1Q
Welcome to *Encyclopedia Vol. 802.1Q* - a comprehensive, vendor neutral reference manual for all things networking.  
*A living reference for mastering protocols, topologies, and real-world networking design*

## ðŸ§­ About This Project

**Vol. 802.1Q** is an ongoing encyclopedia-style manual of everything Iâ€™m learning about networking â€” from Cisco CCNP to multivendor, from routing to automation. It's designed for deep study, long-term retention, and practical, production-ready knowledge.

Youâ€™ll find detailed breakdowns, RFC references, command syntax, use cases, troubleshooting tips, and comparisons â€” organized by protocol and technology.

This is **not** a generic notes repo. Itâ€™s my full-stack network reference for real life and the CCNP/CCIE path and beyond.
