## 🧭 About This Project

**Vol. 802.1Q** is an ongoing encyclopedia-style manual of everything I’m learning about networking — from Cisco CCNP to multivendor, from routing to automation. It's designed for deep study, long-term retention, and practical, production-ready knowledge.

You’ll find detailed breakdowns, RFC references, command syntax, use cases, troubleshooting tips, and comparisons — organized by protocol and technology.

This is **not** a generic notes repo. It’s my full-stack network reference for real life and the CCNP/CCIE path and beyond.
